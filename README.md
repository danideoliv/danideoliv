# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Guerra

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Information Systems student at UFS (Itabaiana-SE) and an IT technician with an interest in software development. I’m motivated by coding — I enjoy learning new languages and tackling programming challenges.

## 💡 Skills & Technologies

* **Languages:** JavaScript, C, C++ ([GitHub][1])
* **Other Tools:** Git and GitHub for version control and project management

## 🚀 Main Projects

Here are some public repositories that showcase my work so far:

## 🎯 What I Aim to Build

I am focused on continuing to practice and learn — whether solving challenges, creating small utility projects, or exploring new concepts in C/C++ and JavaScript. My goal is to grow as a developer and keep my GitHub updated with projects that showcase **my evolution and commitment to clean code and continuous learning**.
